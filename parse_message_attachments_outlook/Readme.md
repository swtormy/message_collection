## Outlook parser
These scripts are for working with attachments in Outlook. When working in the office, sometimes you need to receive a large number of emails with attachments. This repository describes a script that receives attachments from all emails in a certain folder and collects them in one excel file.

The script is divided into two parts:
* Ð¡ollecting emails in the attachment folder ([parse_mail_box.py]((https://pages.github.com/)))
* Analyzing files and compiling a summary file
